In order to be clear about what data is shown, there are lag date indicators labeled on charts throughout the application. Additionally, trend charts will include a lag date portion that is shaded to indicate the time period in which the lag date is active and only data to the left of the shaded area should be considered accurate. As of the latest calculations, 99\% of team injury data arrives in within 10 days of an injury occurrence. We regularly check this and will update lag date calculation as we see improvements in the speed in which the NFL receives injury data.'

An athlete with an NFL Risk Factor of 2.0 has double the risk of injury of an athlete with an NFL Risk factor of 1.0.

This change is necessary due to the cyclical nature of the regular season. In a typical week where a team has a game the following Sunday, this allows users to see an athlete\'s risk through that game.'
